The Onboarding Screen for the DimeKeeper application is designed to provide a smooth and informative introduction for new users. It is implemented in the `onboardingscreen.dart` file. This screen displays a series of slides that guide the user through the main features of the application. Each slide contains a descriptive image and a brief explanation of a specific feature. The Onboarding Screen is crucial for enhancing user understanding and engagement from the first interaction with the application.
